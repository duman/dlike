# Some cool features

* Even if you remove the extension at a point and then re-install it, your likes will remain and you can just use your old data.
* You can use it with any theme, it'll just blend in with the stylesheet of your theme.
* It uses AJAX so that you don't have to reload the page every time you like/unlike something. Thanks to XHR magic.
* It's neither folder dependent nor hardcoded. Due to that it'll install with zero issues to any wordpress installation.
* Heart symbols under posts are drawn with SVG, they will look great no matter how zoomed in you are in your screen.
* Top 10 widget automatically creates list numbers and sorts itself by like amounts.
* Pretty much everything is done with Wordpress API and all injection attacks are tested for safety. _(If you find some open an [issue](https://github.com/tkduman/dlike/issues) please.)_

# Fun fact

I've created this as my intern application project for [Özgür Yazılım](https://ozguryazilim.com.tr). Özgür Yazılım have stated that this code is not for their company and I can use as a reference in the future. I hope I get to use this widget as a reference someday, somewhere. (:
